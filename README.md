# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Works as a classic react app using yarn.

`yarn` & `yarn start`

Note: commit history is not there as repo was previously private and I nuked it to be safe no credentials lurked in the history.
